### BitMED Health Protocol (BXMP)
A foundation of trust for the future of healthcare:

### Abstract
**BitMED** introduces the *BitMED Health Protocol* *(**BXMP**)*, a consortium blockchain protocol and token ecosystem designed to form a secure foundation for the future of health data transaction and management. The BXMP leverages from existing blockchain protocols, including Ethereum, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and Hyperledger, and adds functionalities for the needs of a global healthcare market. BXMP has been developed upon an open-source distributed consensus ledger, Internet protocol, and native token currency called BXM. BitMED enables instant, safe, and low-cost healthcare access of any scale. The protocol supports decentralized applications, smart contracts, prevents double-spending, and supports health outcome nano-payments.

**Note**: *BitMED is a work in progress. New white papers on updates to the system will be posted on our repo. For comments and questions, reach us at BitMED.io/contact.*
